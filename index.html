		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			Groovy is a dynamic language that runs on the JVM. But what does "dynamic" really mean? In this talk, we'll explore what is it means to be a dynamic programming language. We'll see how Groovy adds new methods to existing Java classes -- even final classes like java.lang.String.
		</p>

		<p>
			Like any powerful language feature, there is more than one way to metaprogram new methods and fields onto existing classes. You might decide to do it in a transient fashion at runtime, or in a more permanent way by transforming the bytecode of the compiled class. We'll discuss the pros and cons of both approaches, with lots of live coding examples.
